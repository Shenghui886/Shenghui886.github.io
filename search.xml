Alice wants to prove to Bob that she can distinguish the color of the ball. Bob buys two balls, one red and one blue, but forgets which is which.</p><ul><li>Challenge: Bob shows Alice one of the two balls and asks her whethere it is red or blue.</li><li>Response: Alice tells Bob what color the ball is.</li><li>Verification: If Alice is trully colorblind, the she has a 50% chance of guessing correctly every time</li></ul><p>Repeating this process n times reduces the cheating probability to $\dfrac{1}{2^{n-1}}$. After six rounds, Bob is 96.875% convinced Alice is not colorblind, yet learns nothing about how Alice can distinguish the color of the ball and the specific color of the each ball.</p><h2 id="Types-of-ZKPs">Types of ZKPs</h2><ul><li>Interaction ZKPs: Require back-and-forth communication</li><li>Non-Interaction ZKPs: Generate a proof that everyone can verify.</li></ul>]]></content>
